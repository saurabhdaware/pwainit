PWAinit lets you intialize your PWA development process without writing basic service worker, manifest and index code.

Since v2.1.0 You can initialize into directory where index.html already exists and it will turn your existing site into PWA 🎉.

The module lets you add PWA functionalities like Service Worker, Manifest, Push API

## Usage
- `npm i -g pwainit`
- `pwainit <projectName>`  
- To initialize into same directory use `pwainit .`
- You can also turn existing website into PWA by typing the name of existing folder or by `cd existingWebsite` and `pwainit .`


## What after pwainit?
- After completing above steps you will get files in following structure
```
<your project name>
    -> assets
        -> logo-192.png
        -> logo-512.png
    -> index.html
    -> sw.js
    -> manifest.json
```
- Service worker does not work over file:// protocol thus you will need http://localhost to test the service worker. You can do this using `npm i -g serve` and `serve <project name>`
- Open developer tools, Application -> Service Worker to see active Service Worker and Application -> Manifest to see manifest settings.
- Replace assets/logo-192.png and assets/logo-512.png with your website's logo of 192px and 512px respectively
- If you chose Push API feature you will have to replace value of '< Firebase Web Push Certificate Key >' with your firebase web push key or a key generated from your backend. Read [Firebase Cloud Messaging Docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/js/client#configure_web_credentials_with_fcm) to know how to get web push key on firebase
- For furthur help in development of PWA you might consider reading [Manifest Docs](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/), [Service Worker Docs](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/) and [Push API Docs](https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/introduction-to-push-notifications)
